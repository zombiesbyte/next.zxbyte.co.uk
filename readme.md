## FAQ

- Q: What's the difference between having my game featured in a main yearly listings and a game just listed in the "Free" section.
    - A: The following is required for an entry on the main listing
        - A publishers logo (or a developer logo) with an accompanying website
        - A game box design, logo or decal
        - 3 screen shots must be available
        - A release date
        - A Phyical and/or digital download
        - It must be released for the Spectrum Next
    - A: The following is required for an entry on the free listings
        - Software must be available for free (optional donations is fine)
        - It must be released for the Spectrum Next
- Q: Do you have an "in development" or "coming soon" section?
    - A: Originally, yes until I found that quite a lot of software at these stages do no share assets so I was unable to present them in any meaninful ways which was frustrating. It is with regret that I must exclude the "in development" and "coming soon" sections.
- Q: I have spotted something incorrect about a listed game.
    - A: The webpage is intended to be maintained openly, while you are not able to edit the page directly you can open an issue for the change requested.
- Q: Can I submit a PR (Pull Request)?
    - A: I would prefer not to work like this. The reason being is that I need to be able to maintain this myself without adding work from new features. However, raising an issue to discuss any feature requests is welcomed.
- Q: If my game is both free (digital) and paid (phyiscal) can I have entries in multiple sections?
    - A: Multiple listings is something I like to avoid, so, nope, this includes free games included on phyical releases too. The reason is to prevent unfair advantage over other listings and it makes administration more difficult.


## General Points

- English language is the primary language of the listing and there will be a slight bias to English versions
- Publishers will be favoured primarily over other links and in the case that there are more than one publisher alphabetical order will be used except in the case of English language.
- Principal words will be capitalised, while Articles (such as "a", "an" and "the"), Conjunctions (like "and", "or", and "but"), Prepositions (such as "in", "with", and "of") will be kept lowercase. For ease of searchability, the primary word(s) will be used for alphabetical ordering. I.e. "Some Game", "The Alphabetical System", "Umbrella".

## Availability

Options for availability include

- "Limited Edition" (options: +|&): Just that, there is usually a set limit or a set period of time where orders can be requested but after this there will never be any more like this.
- "While Stocks Last" (options: ∞|&): The intention is to produce 1 batch of stock as a primary availability. There is usually no intention of organising another batch.
- "Stock Available": The stock should always have high availability.

### Additional Options Explained

Because life is never straight forward, these flags help to add further explanation to the terms above.

- + (&#43;): Can be used with "Limited Edition". A small amount of additional copies may be created as and when required/available, these won't be the same as the Limited Edition run but will be more of basic re-release of some core parts of the original limited run.
- ∞ (&#8734;): Infinity, Can be used with "While Stocks Last". Stock levels are likey maintained. There may be further stipulation such as a pre-order batch size restriction which means a new batch is only created once a particular number or time has passed.
- &	(&amp;): The original stock numbers were extended. If there was an unexpected demand on more stock and the original availability has increased for another round.

### Required Details

#### Full Listing Parts

- Background 1 (*bg-1.png)
    - The background provides an area of cover when the screen is greater than 1536px. Therefore this is not alway seen but can be a seperate back ground to the main content area background image. A hue value is replicated from Background 2
- Background 2 (*bg-2.png)
    - This is the main content area background image and is set to cover the containing boxed content area so the background image should not rely on being always fully visiable as it will clip with the size of the content and screen width. A hue value of 0-255 can be provided and affects the colourisation of the background. (note: saturation and lightness have been pre-determined)
- Format (Physical | Digital)
    - This is the main content area background image and is set to cover the containing boxed content area so the background image should not rely on being always fully visiable as it will clip with the size of the content and screen width.
- Format of physical (SM-DVD | SMT-DVD | DVD | SM-BOX | LG-BOX | TAPE)
    - If physical media is available then we should provide information on available released formats. There may be one or more available formats.
        - SM-DVD: h:134mm x w:105mm - small DVD case
        - SMT-DVD: h:170mm x w:105mm - small tall DVD case
        - BLURAY: h:1720mm x w:135mm - BluRay case
        - DVD: h:190mm x w:135mm - DVD
        - SM-BOX: up-to h:172mm x w-150mm - small box
        - LG-BOX: at-least h:173mm x w-151mm - large box
        - TAPE: TBC (future use)
- Availability (Limited edition | While stocks last)
    - Sometimes a release is fixed at a limited edition (no re-releases will be made), these types of releases are usually numbered and certificates of authentication or signatures or extra special gifts are provided. This isn't the same as limited production where there could be future releases. If there was both then we would use both labels i.e. "While stocks last + limited edition"
- Price (Free | Priced)
    - If your product is free or priced. If it is both than we use both labels.
- Release State (In Development | Coming Soon | Released (year))
    - Some projects sit in development for a long time. Coming soon titles should have an imminent release date within 6 months ideally. Once a release is done (digital or physical) then we should include the entry within the year. The years entry is listed in alphabetical order. The reason is for both aiding visitor searchability but also because I do not always know day or even month of most titles release dates (sometimes year is even difficult to track down). Year of initial release will always be used regardless of re-releases (this does not include original Spectrum release if this is a remake)
- Title support text (character limit)
    - Extra supportive text such as "free game included" or other info.
- Game title
    - The title of the game i.e. "Indiana and the Temple of Doom"
- Subtitle
    - Some games have a subtitle, this is not "and the Temple of Doom"
- Description
    - Game description. This is ideally in a single paragraph format and should only be approximately 6-10 sentences with no formatting (i.e. bullet points etc).
- Hero(*hero.png)
    - A hero such as a game box, cover design, a decal, logo or other image. Backgrounds should be transparent.
- Logos (*logo-1.png)
    - Various logos and links. The priority focus is always on the publisher. Any developer logo is secondary unless the developer is also the publisher. Multiple publishers should be arranged in order of alphabetical unless told otherwise. This link should only be to the publishers main website (see 15: Purchase links) for an opportunity to share a direct link for purchase/download
- Screen shots
    - 3 Screen shots, these may be provided with or without a border. All images should match in width and height so that they scale equally with each other. A minimum width of 320px should be provided.
- Purchase links
    - A link to the website for purchase or download. The link should take the visitor directly to the shop/download page for this software. Sometimes it may be neccessary to provide multiple links depending where a visitor is in the world and provide language options and shipping origins.
- The format of the link is as follows: [flag] {country of origin} ({language support})
    - For example I may be selling my game from the UK with this edition of the game having support for English and French
        - United Kingdon (English | Français)
    - while I have a partner selling copies in Italy that sell the game to Itally, Germany and Netherlands
        - Italy (Italiano | Deutsch | Nederlands)
    - and a second partner in Portugal providing the game to Portugal and Spain
        - Portugal (Português | Español)
- Platform
    - This should always be Spectrum Next (depending on the quantity of other systems the game was released on there could be possibility for all other logos but space may be an issue if there are too many)
    - Ideal example could be: [Spectrum Nex] [Nintendo switch] [Steam]
- Genres & Keywords
    - Genre is a stict classification of the game. There can be multiple genres associated with the title. The Themed keywords provide ancillary tagging for the game with selected keywords and meaninful tags that would aid search (future feature).
